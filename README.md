- ⚡ Fun fact: I have discovered the programming area for less then two years and now I am super interested in work as a developer to solve some problens that every person faces on it dayli base or design porgrams and scripts for the aerospace industry.


## My story with programming
 My first contact with programming lenguages was when I was 15, I had downloaded the grasshooper app from google and used the app for almost 5 mounths. Years later I have started at college and had my first class of programming logic, after one semester learning C during these lessons, I had a challenge to figure out how to make a lora V2 1276 works with a raspberry pi 2w on a python script. I have started learning python since then but, recently, I've decided to learn other subjects such as linux and C++ to increase my technical knwoledge on embedded systems (my carrer goal).
## My Achievements
- I took part on the largest sounding rocket competition of the world (Spaceport America CUP 🚀👨‍🚀). Representing my state (Minas Gerais), my country (Brazil) and getting a good position for our **first** participation, **we got 23 of 151 teams**;
- I became the manager of the satellite core of my team;
- I took part in an article while I as in the second semester of the college.
## My goals
To be honest I have a lot of goals on my list, but the main goals are:
- Get a job as a developer working for a national or international company;
- Develop more skills and increase the ones I already have;
- Get my C2 leve certificate of english;
- Win the Spaceport America showing to the world that here, in Brazil, we are able to do anything.
